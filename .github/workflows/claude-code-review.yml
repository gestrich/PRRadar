            **IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
            1. Create a directory called `review-output` using `mkdir -p review-output`
            2. Write your complete review summary to `review-output/review-summary.md` using the Write tool
            3. Your structured output MUST include the rich JSON format with:
               - success: true if review completed, false if it failed
               - feedback: array of violation objects, each with:
                 - file: path to the file
                 - segment: name of the code segment
                 - rule: name of the violated rule
                 - score: violation score (1-10)
                 - lineNumber: line number in the diff
                 - githubComment: concise comment for GitHub
                 - details: detailed explanation
               - summary: object with:
                 - summaryFile: "review-output/review-summary.md"
                 - totalSegments: number of segments reviewed
                 - totalViolations: count of violations (score >= 5)
                 - categories: object mapping category names to {aggregateScore, summary}

            Only include items in the feedback array that have score >= 5 (violations).
